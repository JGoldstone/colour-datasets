  abstract     = {Camera spectral sensitivity functions relate scene
    radiance with captured RGB triplets. They are important for many
    computer vision tasks that use color information, such as
    multispectral imaging, color rendering, and color constancy. In
    this paper, we aim to explore the space of spectral sensitivity
    functions for digital color cameras. After collecting a database
    of 28 cameras covering a variety of types, we find this space
    convex and two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we
    propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using
    regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a
    single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show
    the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating
    camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also
    show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral
    sensitivities - simulation of color rendering for cameras and
    computational color constancy.},
