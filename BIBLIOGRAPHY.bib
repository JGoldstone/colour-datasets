  abstract     = {Camera spectral sensitivity functions relate scene
    radiance with captured RGB triplets. They are important for many
    computer vision tasks that use color information, such as
    multispectral imaging, color rendering, and color constancy. In
    this paper, we aim to explore the space of spectral sensitivity
    functions for digital color cameras. After collecting a database
    of 28 cameras covering a variety of types, we find this space
    convex and two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we
    propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using
    regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a
    single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show
    the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating
    camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also
    show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral
    sensitivities - simulation of color rendering for cameras and
    computational color constancy.},

@article{Luo1999,
  abstract     = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides
    to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of
    applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking
    tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking
    program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and
    systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide
    sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the
    poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit
    solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top
    10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}
    for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default
    Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and
    scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein
    structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed
    Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides)
    while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for
    a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was
    available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked
    successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized
    polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of
    limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of
    applicability for this approach.},
